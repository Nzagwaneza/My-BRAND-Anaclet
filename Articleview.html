                        <strong>My journal in coding life</strong>
                    </div>
                        <div><p>Once upon a time, I walked the halls of hospitals in the noble profession of nursing. The world of healthcare was my domain, and caring for others was my daily rhythm. Little did I know that my path would take a fascinating turn, leading me into the intricate world of coding. <br> <br>

                            As a nurse, I witnessed firsthand the impact technology had on patient care. It was during those moments, surrounded by beeping machines and digital records, that I felt a spark of curiosity. What if I could contribute to healthcare not only at the bedside but also behind the scenes, shaping the very tools that enhance the patient experience?<br> <br>
                            
                            With this newfound curiosity, I embarked on a journey into the realm of coding. The transition from stethoscopes to lines of code was not without its challenges, but each challenge became a stepping stone. I enrolled in the ATLP coding program, ready to unravel the mysteries of programming languages and algorithms. <br> <br>
                            The initial days were like learning a new language, decoding the syntax and understanding the logic that powered software. But with every line of code written, I discovered the joy of problem-solving and the immense satisfaction of seeing my creations come to life on the screen. <br> <br>
                            Coding is more than a skill; it's a journey of continuous learning and growth. <br> <br>
