                Once upon a time, I walked the halls of hospitals in the noble
                profession of nursing. The world of healthcare was my domain, and
                caring for others was my daily rhythm. Little did I know that my
                path would take a fascinating turn, leading me into the intricate
                world of coding. As a nurse, I witnessed firsthand the impact technology had on
                patient care.It was during those moments, surrounded by beeping
                machines and digital records, that I felt a spark of curiosity.

              What if I could contribute to healthcare not only at the bedside
              but also behind the scenes, shaping the very tools that enhance
              the patient experience?<br />
              <br />

              With this newfound curiosity, I embarked on a journey into the
              realm of coding. The transition from stethoscopes to lines of code
              was not without its challenges, but each challenge became a
              stepping stone. I enrolled in the ATLP coding program, ready to
              unravel the mysteries of programming languages and algorithms.
              <br />
              <br />
              The initial days were like learning a new language, decoding the
              syntax and understanding the logic that powered software. But with
              every line of code written, I discovered the joy of
              problem-solving and the immense satisfaction of seeing my
              creations come to life on the screen. <br />
              <br />
              Coding is more than a skill; it's a journey of continuous learning
              and growth. <br />
